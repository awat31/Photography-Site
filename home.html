        I'm Aaron Watkins, a hobbiest photographer from Aberdeenshire, Scotland.<br>
        I began shooting just on my phone around my local area and on holiday, after realising I enjoyed it I purchased my first camera,
        a
        <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/products/sony/compacts/cybershot_dsch400">Sony DSC-H400</a>
        to help me shoot more.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a While I felt the limitations of a locked body camera, so I purchased an upgrade, a
        <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonic-lumix-dmc-g7">Panasonic Lumix G7</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was when my photography took off more, and I still have this camera.
        I now live in Edinburgh where I study

          I created this website myself in HTML during a Web Technologies module at uni, where we were taught HTML, CSS, and how to create
          sites, I thougth it was a great chance to both learn how to do this, but also create something super useful I can use
          at the end of it!
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary style has been Landscape Photography, as I had so much beautiful country around me, but in moving to Edinburgh, and with
          my own personal preference, I have began to focus more on portrait photography, along with Urban City photography, since it's what I have
          around me now. The other types in the images section of this site are things I've dabbled in, but still wanted to showcase, since they
          are still examples of my work, but aren't my primary day to day focus.
