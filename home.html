          I'm Aaron Watkins, a hobbiest photographer and CyberSecurity and Forensics student from Aberdeenshire, Scotland.<br>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
            I created this website myself in HTML during a Web Technologies module at uni, where we were taught HTML, CSS, and how to create
            sites, I thougth it was a great chance to both learn how to do this, but also create something super useful I can use
            at the end of it, so here is my site, completely done myself!
            I'll add a section soon about my degree work and CyberSecurity.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">
            My primary style has been Landscape Photography, as I had so much beautiful country around me, but in moving to Edinburgh, and with
            my own personal preference, I have began to focus more on portrait photography, along with Urban City photography, since it's what I have
            around me now. The other types in the images section of this site are things I've dabbled in, but still wanted to showcase, since they
            are still examples of my work, but aren't my primary day to day focus.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:left">
            As it's still a work in progress, the website isn't perfect on phones and stuff yet, and some of the image layouts might be a bit weird
            on different screens, I am working on it! If you come across anything weird please ping me a messgage about it and I can look into fixing it!
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Cheers,
          </p>
