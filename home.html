              Hey!
            </h2>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              I'm Aaron Watkins, a hobbiest Photographer and CyberSecurity and Forensics Student from Aberdeenshire, Scotland.<br>
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              My primary style has been Landscape Photography, as I had so much beautiful country around me. But in moving to Edinburgh, and with
              my own personal preference, I have begun to focus more on Portrait Photography, along with Urban City Photography.<br>
              The other types in the images section of this site are things I've dabbled in and still wanted to showcase, since they
              are still examples of my work, but aren't my primary day to day focus.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              I coded this website myself in HTML during a Web Technologies module at uni, where we were taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how to create
              sites.<br>I thought it was a great chance to both learn how to code websites, but also create something super useful I can use
              at the end of it, so here is my site, completely done myself!<br>
              I'll add a section soon about my degree work and CyberSecurity.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              As it's still a work in progress, the website isn't perfect on phones and stuff yet, and some of the image layouts and text sizes might be a bit weird
              on different screens, I am working on it! If you come across anything weird please ping me a message about it and I can look into fixing it!
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Cheers,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Aaron
