    <h3><u>Camera</u></h3>
    <p>
      I shoot with a
      <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-DMC-G7MEB-K-Compact-System-Camera/dp/B00XVREKE6/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Lumix%2BG7&qid=1580211772&sr=8-4&th=1"target="_blank"><b>Panasonic Lumix G7</b></a>
      <br>
      It is a
      <a href="https://expertphotography.com/micro-four-thirds/"target="_blank">Cropped Sensor</a> Mirrorless Camera.<br>
      I like it as it's very small and lightweight (a massive point of mirrorless) but still produces amazing images.

      <h3><u>Lenses</u></h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-II-VARIO-ASPH-14/dp/B00B7FOVAM/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=lumix+g7+14-42mm&qid=1580212269&sr=8-5"target="_blank"><b>14-41mm Lens</b></a>.
        <br>
        This lens is super useful for wide landscape shots where I want loads in focus,<br>
        but also can get a bit of a zoom to tone in on further
        away subjects and get a bit of a depth of field.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-Compact-Lightweight-Digital-Interchangeable/dp/B00DPEK7E2/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=20mm+lumix&qid=1580212468&sr=8-2"target="_blank"><b>20mm Prime</b></a>
        <br>This is my everyday lens.<br>
        Although it doesn't have the dynamicism of zoom like the other two, it does have a super low (F/1.7) aperture, <br>
        which means I can get a super depth of field no matter what I'm shooting, and generally I've found it easier that I originally thought to get all range of shots,<br>
        from close ups to landcapes with it. <br>
        It produces super artistic shots and is super small and easy to move around with, so it's my go-to for sure.
      </p>

        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-45-150-LUMIX-HFS45150-mm-Lens/dp/B010Q5EG58/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=lumix+42-150+lens&qid=1580212877&sr=8-2"target="_blank"><b>45-150mm Lens</b></a>
        <br>
        This is probably my least used lens, but the one I wish I could use more.<br>
        It is great for shooting things from a distance, I have taken shots from boats and even some portraits with this lens, <br>
        and it creates a great depth of field with its zoom, so this is great for those situations when I need to zoom in on wildlife or a far subject.

      <h3><u>Filters</u></h3>
      <p>
        I use a variety of filters to help me with specific conditions and for specific effects.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://mygobe.com/uk/nd1000-filter-1peak.html"target="_blank"><b>ND 1000</b></a><br>
        An ND filter is used to block daylight so that you can do an exposure during the day. This is great for natural light photos with <br>
        milky water effects, which I've done in multiple locations and is a very famous photgraphy trick.
        <br>You can see examples of me using this effect in
        <a href = "myimages.html">My Images</a><br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://mygobe.com/uk/46mm-duet-filter-kit-1peak.html"target="_blank"><b>Polariser</b></a><br>

        A polariser is used to block certain wave directions of light and allow others through, so it is very useful for shooting things that reflect<br>
        harsh light, or just in a weird way, such as shooting water or cars. The limiting of the light allowed to reach the sensor makes the images much<br>
        more clean.
        Mine is from
        <a href="https://mygobe.com/"target="_blank">Gobe</a>.
        They have super reasoanable prices for their super high quality filters, and also plant trees for every purchase made.<br> So help save the
        planet too. You can read about their effort
        <a href = "https://mygobe.com/uk/tree-sites/"target="_blank">here</a>.

        <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manfrotto-Compact-Advanced-Aluminium-Tripod/dp/B00K0P067W/ref=sr_1_2?adgrpid=51899637503&gclid=CjwKCAiA1L_xBRA2EiwAgcLKA9OBQYAT7SxefkzofZ8IBFbJnPeszq6hBYUig5lMA7BGHUY331vlnhoCSFUQAvD_BwE&hvadid=259047501976&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9046897&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=13350704840728874496&hvtargid=kwd-320521855634&hydadcr=3956_1711766&keywords=manfrotto+tripod&qid=1580213675&sr=8-2"target="_blank"><b>Tripod</b></a>
        <br>
        My tripod is from manfrotto, a well known brand and has the quality you'd expect. It's literally as tall as me when fully extended,<br>
        so it super useful for every type of shooting at any height, including; self portraits, exposures, or just when I need the camera to stay completely still.<br>
        It is also nicely weighted, not to be too heavy to carry, but heavy enough to be stable, honestly such a useful bit of kit.
