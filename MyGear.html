    <h3>Camera</h3>
    <p>
      I shoot with a Panasonic Lumix G7 - Amazon Link
      <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-DMC-G7MEB-K-Compact-System-Camera/dp/B00XVREKE6/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Lumix%2BG7&qid=1580211772&sr=8-4&th=1">here</a>
      <br>
      It is a
      <a href="https://expertphotography.com/micro-four-thirds/">Cropped Senson</a> mirrorless camera.<br>
      I Like it as it's very small and lightweight (a massive point of mirrorless) but still produces amazing images.

      <h3>Lenses</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-II-VARIO-ASPH-14/dp/B00B7FOVAM/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=lumix+g7+14-42mm&qid=1580212269&sr=8-5">14-41mm Lens</a>.
        <br>
        This lens is super useful for wide landscape shots where I want loads in focus, but also can get a bit of a zoom to tone in on further
        away subjects and get a bit of a depth of field.
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-Compact-Lightweight-Digital-Interchangeable/dp/B00DPEK7E2/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=20mm+lumix&qid=1580212468&sr=8-2">20mm Prime</a>
        <br>This is my everyday lens.<br>
        Although it doesn't have the dynamicism of zoom like the other two, it does have a super low (f1.7) aperture, which means I can get a super
        depth of field no matter what I'm shooting, and generally I've found it easier that I originally thought to get all range of shots, from
        close ups to landcapes with it. It produces super artistic shots and is super small and easy to move around with, so it's my go-to for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Panasonic-45-150-LUMIX-HFS45150-mm-Lens/dp/B010Q5EG58/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=lumix+42-150+lens&qid=1580212877&sr=8-2">45-150mm Lens</a>
        <br>
        This is probably my least used lens, but the one I wish I could use more.
        It is great for shooting things from a distance, I have taken shots from boats and even some portraits with this lens, and it creates
        a great depth of field with its zoom, so this is great for those situations when I need to zoom in on wildlife or a far subject.

      <h3>Filters</h3>
      <p>
        I use a variety of filters to help me with specific conditions and for specific effects.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://mygobe.com/uk/nd1000-filter-1peak.html">ND 1000</a><br>
        An ND filter is used to block daylight so that you can do an exposure during the day. This is great for natural light photos with
        milky water effects, which I've done in multiple locations and is a very famous photgraphy trick.
        <br>You can see examples of me using this effect in
        <a href = "myimages.html">My Images</a><br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://mygobe.com/uk/46mm-duet-filter-kit-1peak.html">Polariser</a><br>

        A polariser is used to block certain wave directions of light and allow others through, so it is very useful for shooting things that reflect
        harsh light, or just in a weird way, such as shooting water or cars. The limiting of the light allowed to reach the sensor makes the images much
        more clean.
        Mine is from
        <a href="https://mygobe.com/">Gobe</a>.
        They have super reasoanable prices for their super high quality filters, and also plant trees for every purchase made. So help save the
        planet too. You can read about their effort
        <a href = "https://mygobe.com/uk/tree-sites/">here</a>.

        <h3>Accessories</h3>
        <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Manfrotto-Compact-Advanced-Aluminium-Tripod/dp/B00K0P067W/ref=sr_1_2?adgrpid=51899637503&gclid=CjwKCAiA1L_xBRA2EiwAgcLKA9OBQYAT7SxefkzofZ8IBFbJnPeszq6hBYUig5lMA7BGHUY331vlnhoCSFUQAvD_BwE&hvadid=259047501976&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9046897&hvnetw=g&hvpos=1t1&hvqmt=e&hvrand=13350704840728874496&hvtargid=kwd-320521855634&hydadcr=3956_1711766&keywords=manfrotto+tripod&qid=1580213675&sr=8-2">Tripod</a>
        <br>
        My tripod is from manfrotto, a well known brand and has the quality you'd expect. It's literally as tall as me when fully extended, so it super
        useful for every type of shooting at any height, including self portraits, exposures, or just when I need the camera to stay completely still.
        It is also nicely weighted, not to be too heavy to carry, but heavy enough to be stable, honestly such a useful bit of kit.
