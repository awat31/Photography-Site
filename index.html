              Hey!
            </h2>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              I'm Aaron Watkins, a Photographer and CyberSecurity Student from Scotland!<br>
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              My primary style has been Landscape Photography, as I had so much beautiful country around me at home in Royal Deeside, but in moving to Edinburgh, and with
              my own personal preference, I began to focus more on Portrait, Urban and City Photography.<br>
              I've included some other styles of photos in the images section to showcase things I've dabbled in but aren't necessarily my primary focus.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              I started coding this website for a Web Technologies module at University, where we were taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how to create
              websites.<br>I thought it was a great chance to both learn how to code websites, but also create something super useful I can use
              at the end of it!<br>
              I kept it going after I completed the module as I was enjoying what I was doing and this is the result, my site, coded myself! <br>
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              As it's still a work in progress, the website may not render perfectly on some devices, but I am working on it! If you come across anything unusual please ping me a message and I can look into fixing it!
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Cheers,
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
              Aaron
